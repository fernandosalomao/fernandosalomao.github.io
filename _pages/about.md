Hi, I’m Fernando 👋

I am a Cloud & AI Architecture Leader with 10+ years of experience designing, building, and operating large-scale technology platforms across Azure, AWS, and hybrid environments.

My career sits at the intersection of architecture, engineering, and leadership. I have worked hands-on with cloud platforms, Infrastructure as Code, DevOps, security, and platform governance, while also leading teams, setting technical direction, and helping organizations scale safely and sustainably.

## What I’m passionate about

- Designing secure, resilient, and well-governed cloud platforms
- Turning complex problems into simple, repeatable solutions
- Enabling engineering teams through automation, standards, and clear architecture
- Bridging the gap between strategy and real-world delivery

## Beyond work

I am an avid homelab enthusiast, always experimenting with technologies like virtualization, containers, Kubernetes, storage platforms, and media stacks. I believe the best architects never stop building, breaking, and learning.

## What you’ll find here

This blog is a space where I share:

- Practical cloud and architecture insights
- Lessons learned from real-world platforms and operations
- Experiments, side projects, and technical deep dives
- Thoughts on leadership, careers, and modern engineering practices

Whether you’re a cloud architect, engineer, or simply curious about how large-scale systems are designed and operated, I hope you find something useful here.

Thanks for stopping by!
